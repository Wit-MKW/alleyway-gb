# Alleyway
In this repository you will find a disassembly of the 1989 Game Boy launch title
Alleyway. The game was not very well-received, be it in 1989 when it released
with the Game Boy or in 2011 when it became one of the 3DS's first Virtual
Console games, but in 2024 Nintendo decided to make it available to Nintendo
Switch Online members as part of the 35th anniversary of the Game Boy, which is
how I first played the game, at which point I decided to disassemble it.

To build, use the shell script `build.sh` in the root of the source tree. This
will produce a 32 KiB file in the `src` directory named `Alleyway (World).gb`
with a CRC32 of `5cc01586`, a header CRC32 of `cbaa161b`, and a SHA1 of
`0cf2b8d0428f389f5361f67a0cd1ace05a1c75cc`.
